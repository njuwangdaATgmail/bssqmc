In this folder, we provide some examples which can be directly used or slightly modified for practical applications. 

The name rule of each example is 'lattice_-model'
+ lattice: square, honeycomb, triangle, kagome, CuO2, bi-square, ...
+ model: hubbard, spin-orbit coupling (soc), general Coulomb (UVJ), phonon(Holstein, Peierls, Frohlich...)

+ The program prepare_input can help one prepare the input file. However, it's not very smart now, e.g. checking the validity of parameters.
