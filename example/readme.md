In this folder, we provide some examples which can be directly used or slightly modified for practical applications. 

The name rule of each example is 'lattice_-model'
+ lattice: square, honeycomb, triangular, kagome, CuO2, ...
+ model: SU(N), spin-orbit coupling, Coulomb(U,V,J,J'), phonon(Holstein, Peierls, Frohlich...)

+ The program prepare_input can help one prepare the input file. However, it's not very smart now.
